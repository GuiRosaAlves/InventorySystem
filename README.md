This Unity project serves as a demonstration of a simple and versatile 2D inventory system. It is not intended to be a fully-fledged game but rather showcases the functionality and mechanics of the inventory system. The project's main purpose is to provide developers with a practical example of implementing an inventory system in their games or applications.

## Key Features

- **Resolution Support:** The inventory system has been designed to adapt to most 16:9 resolutions, ensuring a consistent and responsive user experience across different screen sizes.

- **Add Items to Inventory:** You can easily add items to the inventory by clicking the "Add Random Item" button. Observe how items are organized and managed in the inventory grid.
  
- **Swap Items:** To further manage your inventory, you can swap items between slots. Simply drag an item from one slot to another to perform the swap.

- **Split Stacks of Items:** You have the option to split stacks of items in the inventory. Use the middle mouse button to split a stack in half, or use the right mouse button to specify a custom split quantity.

- **Open and Close Inventory:** The inventory can be accessed and closed using the "Open/Close" button. Experience the smooth and intuitive user interface for managing your items.

- **Scriptable Objects:** The project makes extensive use of Unity's Scriptable Objects to facilitate data-driven design, making it easier to create, modify, and manage items in the inventory.

- **Unity TextMeshPro:** The project utilizes TextMeshPro for handling rich text and enhanced typography, providing an aesthetically pleasing UI.
